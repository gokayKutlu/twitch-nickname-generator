# Note
This script probably no longer works, because Twitch stopped using their Kraken API.

# About the script
This python script generates nicknames and checks if there is any channel with that nickname on Twitch API. Most nicknames in this script with 5 characters or more are available.

# Usage
Unpack the twitch-nickname-generator.rar. In the twitch-nickname-generator folder, launch "twitch-nickname-generator.exe". When you launch the script, you'll need to input a character sequence. You can choose any character sequence. You will use b for consonant and a for vowel. For example: if you input babbab you are going to get nicknames with this sequence: consonant-vowel-consonant-consonant-vowel-consonant.
